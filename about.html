		As we all know, farmers are the backbone of our country. Our project is for farmers. For farmers, fertilizers are very important for growing plants. Our government is distributing that fertilizer as a subsidy (at a lower rate), so all farmers are willing to take the fertilizers like 20-20, urea, potassium, etc. from the government only. Here the problem is in the system of fertilizer distribution. That is, when the farmers know that the fertilizers are coming to their nearby coldstore (Godham), they usually confirm that the load is coming and farm lines and wait for the fertilizer distribution officer to come and distribute the fertilizers. In this process, the farmers stand in the line at 5 or 6 in the morning, and the fertilizer distribution officer comes and distributes the fertilizers at 10 or 11 a.m. as per their duty time. Here, farmers have to wait for hours and hours in line to get the fertilizer. Sometimes farmers will not get the fertilizer because of a lack of stock. The first point we (team-planters) want to specify is that the farmer does not know how much stock there is and some other information. The second point is a waste of time waiting in line. The last point is that if the farmer does not get the fertilizer on that day, no work is completed. If the farmer used to go for daily wages on that day, he would be with empty hands, i.e., no fertilizers and no daily wage either. So, to solve the above problems, we are going to develop a website named "PLANTER", a project on fertilizer distribution, which consists of the stock and all other information about a particular fertilizer name by name, and we can also book the fertilizers on this website. With our project, we want to help farmers in this way, and we want them to spend their time in the fields rather than in front of the coldstore (Godham). On our website, the farmer can see the stock and book their fertilizers, and they can save time as well.
