		<font color="blue" face="mistral"><h2>
		THIS IS THE WEBSITE WHICH IS VERY USEFUL TO THE FARMERS<br>
		WE (FARMERS) ARE GETTING THE FERTILIZERS LIKE UERA,20-20,POTASSIUM,ETC.., AND SEEDS FROM THE GOVERNAMENT MAINLY BECAUSE , THROUGH GOVERNAMENT WE GET
		THEM<br> FOR SOME LESS RATE WHEN COMPARE TO OTHER SECTORS .<br><br>
		THEN MOST OF THE FARMERS GET THEM BY GOVERNAMENT ONLY.<br>
		AND ANOTHER MAIN REASON IS THAT-> WHEN THAY BUY THEM FROM ANOTHER SECTOR (OTHER THEN GOVERNAMENT ) FARMERS HAS TO BARRY THE TRANSPORT CHARGESS ALSO<br>
		WHEN THAY TAKE FROM THE GOVERNAMENT (GODHAM NEAR BY FARMER) THAY CAN REDUSE THEIR TRANSPORT CHARGES AND ALL.....<br><br>
		BUT HEAR THE FARMER CAN'T KNOW HOW MUCH STOCK IS THERE IN THE GODHAM AND HOW MANY WILL GET THE PRODUCTOS AND STANDING IN THE LINE <br>
		FOR HOURS AND HOURS BY WEASTING THEIR TIME <br><br></h2></font>
